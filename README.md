# sudokuInCpp

This is a WIP sudoku puzzle generator and solver. At the moment I've implemented file I/O for creating boards, an ASCII printer for showing the boards, and several functions designed to help with auto solving. This is based on a basic sudoku solver that I wrote in [Python](https://github.com/CameronDennis/sudokuInPy) previously.

TODO: Implement solving, random generation, difficulty selection, and more...
